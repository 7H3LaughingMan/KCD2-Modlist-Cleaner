# KCD2 Modlist Cleaner

This tool is designed to fix your Kingdom Come Deliverance II saves temporarily until Warhorse fixes the underlying issue.

This is a re-implementation of the tool designed by [Catlord](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Catllord).

## How To Use

Once you have this tool installed all you need to do is right-click on the save file in question and select the "Clean Modlist" option. If you don't see this option you are using the new context menu and will have to hold shift when right-clicking.
